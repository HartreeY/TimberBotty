## Info
Tested on the Steam version of Timberman v2.10, but should work on any version. 

Tested on a mediocre machine; perfomance may vary on different machines. The bot can reach ~3650 score with **delay** = 0.11.

Note: sometimes the bot fails to read the screen. In that case simply click "Stop" and "Start" again.
