## Info
Tested on the Steam version of Timberman v2.10, but should work on any version. 

Tested on a mediocre machine; perfomance may vary on different machines. With an unbroken chain of key presses, the bot can reach 2007 score with the current program.

Note: sometimes the bot fails to read the screen. In that case simply click "Stop" and "Start" again.
