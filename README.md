## Info
Tested on the Steam version of Timberman v2.10, but should work on any version. Tested on a mediocre machine; perfomance might differ on different machines. The bot can reach 2007 score with the current program.

Note: sometimes the bot fails to read the screen. In that case simply click "Stop" and "Start" again.
